### Week 1
Week 1 was pretty adventurous as everything seemed new and differenent.
As a communication designer I have a softspot for Software Fundamentals, I use a lot of Adobe Softwares and was ready to jump into programming involving softwares or visual language.

Learning Scratch was such a fun challenge for me that I decided to go ahead and create a fun game.
It can be viewed here [Scratch Projects](/SoftwareNotes/Scratch Learnings.md)

It was pretty challenging to make it function flawlessly. I had to go through a lot of testing to make it finally work the right way.
I tried different functions, costume changes, positions, sounds and variables to create a fun game that I would play more than once.
It would exactly like putting legos together but so much more complex to join them to make a smoooth code.


### Week2
Week 2 might have been my most challenging week so far. I have been trying to work with GitHub for the longest time.
When I finally learned how it can be used for collaboration and creating version control system for smallest to biggest projects.

I feel GitHub can go a long way when used as a team of collaborators for various projects, especially for a team of hybrid roles like designers, coders & others.

This is the most fun I had, figuring Git and GitHub and this would probably be my life admin project directory from now onwards.


### Week3
Week 3 tapped into my being good at Maths and felt like learning a new language, which was the case only this was a programming language that made me write my very first full code.

I have worked with CSS and HTML before but mostly just to make slight changes and never really write a whole code.

I had a blast coding a calculator and another one to find Dog's Age in Dog Years
My code can be found here [Dog Age Calculator](/SoftwareNotes/Python Learnings.md)

It was challenging at first to even get my Python to work with Visual Code.
I spent hours trying to change the old python 2.7 to python 3.9
Once I finally got it to work, I realised that I has syntaxes which worked different for both the version of Pythons, I had to work a little bit to get them right but once that was all updated, the code itself was perfect which ended up making these challenges seem like nothing.


### Week 4 & Week 5
Week 4 and Week felt like a big mix of understanding Agile Rituals but in not a long time.
Doing different exercises with peers in the campus, engaged a new way of working and planted a little idea seed for my independent software project.
It's only after experimenting with a quick stand-up, I realised how I want my project to work and flow and what I am inclined more towards.
I am inspired to experiment with Figma and build an App mockup for Candle Making.
