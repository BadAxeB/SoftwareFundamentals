Personal Notes and Reflection Journal navigating my journey and thoughts about the Software Fundamental Resources

I have divided my learnings and my thoughts seperately, while my reflective journal shares my thoughts of my challenges every week.
The Software Notes, display my understanding and learning of different softwares with code/ projects produced using those learnings.
