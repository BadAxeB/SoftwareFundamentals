## Hello There!
Welcome to my world of organised chaos of learning how to be a programmer.

I have divided my learnings and my thoughts seperately, while my reflective journal shares my thoughts of my challenges every week with some in-depth internal and general reflections on some cues provided by the tutor.

The Software Notes, display my understanding and learning of different softwares with code/ projects produced using those learnings.

You can go through the turmoild of my reflections in my Reflective Journal here [ReflectiveJournal](ReflectiveJournal.md)

Or,

Enjoy my quick understanding of Software Explorations here:
