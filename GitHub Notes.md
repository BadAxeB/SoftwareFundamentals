## Introduction Notes:

GitHub is a version control system which let's you save all the changes over time and also track them, go back and revert them if needed.
Git is the actual open source software that allows you to control all these version changes
GitHub is the web server that allows you to have teams and work collaborativeley.
Git + GitHub together brings together the term social coding as people can work from any part of the world and still work together.

## Repositories & Commiting Changes:
Repositories are like folders of the project where you can add files as per your needs.
You have to save the changes/ additions you are making by pressing "Commit Change" which adds the commits to your documents/ code.
Every commit has it's own hashtag code, which allows you to go back to whatever commit you need.

## Branches & Forking with Pull Requests
Branches are good if there is more than one team member working on a project
Every contributor can add a branch with the changes which can later be pulled into the main branch as needed
All the commits from the new branches needs to be pulled so they can be reviewed before being added to the main branch.
Forking on the other hand creates a whole copy of the repository.
It is for changes that are suggested to the main branch which can be from any source.
They also have to be pulled but it's completely independent of the actual repository.
